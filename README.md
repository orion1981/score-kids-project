# score-kids-project

    This web app will allow a user to track a sporting event from the sidelines of a game.  They will be able to update stats of players throughout the game with the click of a button.

-
    As a user you will be able to pick teams or create a new ones and then initiate a game with location and time of game.  

-
    Games will track team scores, shots and remaining time. A user will be able to stop the game clock when needed as well as add or delete player stats when necessary.

-  
    The final page will be a stat page from the game previously played. That will show team totals and also allow versatility to view individual contributions

-  
    The project is built with a rails back end API and using a react for client side interface.
